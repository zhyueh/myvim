*yavdb.txt*
This is a generic Vim <->Debugger Interface Tool designed to be adaptable to
any debugger application.  Currently supported debuggers include jdb and gdb.

Script Requirements:
-VIM compiled with Signs, Client-Server, and Python support.
-Python 2.5
-An operating system with support for named pipes

Using YAVDB:

  yavdb [-s servername] [-t type] <debugger command line>

  -s specifies the Vim servername.  If no VIM (or GVIM) window exists with
  		this servername, a new GVIM window will be opened.  If not specified,
		the servername 'VimDebugger' will be used.  If multiple applications
		are being debugged simultaneously unique servernames must be used.

  -t can be used to override the debugger type.  If this option is omitted
  		the debugger name will be used as the type.  Currently supported
		debugger types include 'gdb' and 'jdb'.  Note that jdb will only
		correctly notify VIM of events when classnames are identical to
		filenames (other than the .java extension).

  VIM will have the following key mappings set:

  <C-F5> Run Application
  <F5> Continue Execution
  <F7> Step Into a Function
  <F8> Next Instruction
  <F9> Set Breakpoint
  <C-F9> Unset Breakpoint
  <F10> Print variable value under cursor
